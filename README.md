# Property Management System — SQL Project

This project is a complete SQL based data management system built for a property management company to track occupancy, leases, maintenance activities, inspections, clients, and operational costs.  
It demonstrates practical experience in database design, **data modeling, ETL style scripting, and analytical SQL reporting.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This system was designed as a real-world simulation of a property company's data workflows.  
It supports:

- Daily operational tracking (OLTP)  
- Analytical reporting for business insights  
- Strong relational structure with enforced integrity  
- Scalable design suitable for BI tools and downstream dashboards  

The project includes both **operational schema** and **analytical components**, showcasing full-stack SQL development.

## Database Components

### **1. Operational OLTP Schema**
Includes core business entities:

- **Buildings**  
- **Apartments**  
- **Clients**  
- **Staff**  
- **Leases**  
- **Maintenance Requests**  
- **Inspections**

This schema enforces:

- Primary & foreign keys  
- CHECK constraints  
- Cascading rules  
- Consistent relationships  
- Clean normalized design  

### **2. Analytical Reporting Layer**
A simplified star style model was created for:

- Occupancy metrics  
- Maintenance performance  
- Utility & cost analysis  
- Turnaround time calculations

## 📁 Files Included in This Repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CreateDB_Table_Query.sql** | SQL script to create all tables, constraints, and relationships (DDL) |
| **InsertValues_Query.sql** | SQL script to populate tables with realistic sample data (DML) |
| **DataDictionary.xlsx** | Full documentation of schema, fields, data types, and definitions |
| **Project_Report.pdf** | Final write-up explaining schema design, insights, and results |

## 📊 Business Insights Enabled

This SQL system allows property managers to answer questions such as:

- What is the occupancy rate by building, apartment type, or time period?  
- How long do maintenance tasks take to complete on average?  
- Which buildings generate the most maintenance workload?  
- Which clients or unit types have the highest turnover?  
- Which cost centers contribute most to operational expenses?  

These insights support operations, resource allocation, and financial decision making.
